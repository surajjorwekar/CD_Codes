<h1><a name="SEC5" href="http://perso.esiee.fr/~najmanl/compil/Flex/flex_toc.html#SEC5">Input and Output Files</a></h1>

<p>
<code>flex</code>'s actions are specified by definitions (which may include
embedded C code) in one or more input files.  The primary
output file is <tt>`lex.yy.c'</tt>.  You can also use some of the
command-line options to get diagnostic output
(see section <a href="http://perso.esiee.fr/~najmanl/compil/Flex/flex_3.html#SEC17">Command-line Options</a>).
This chapter gives the details of how to structure your input to
define the scanner you need.

</p>



<h2><a name="SEC6" href="http://perso.esiee.fr/~najmanl/compil/Flex/flex_toc.html#SEC6">Format of the Input File</a></h2>

<p>
The <code>flex</code> input file consists of three sections, separated by a
line with just <samp>`%%'</samp> in it:

</p>

<pre><var>definitions</var>
%%
<var>rules</var>
%%
<var>user code</var>
</pre>

<p>
The <var>definitions</var> section contains declarations of simple name
definitions to simplify the scanner specification, and declarations of
start conditions, which are explained in a later section.

</p>
<p>
Name definitions have the form:

</p>

<pre><var>name</var> <var>definition</var>
</pre>

<p>
The <var>name</var> is a word beginning with a letter or an underscore
(<samp>`_'</samp>) followed by zero or more letters, digits, <samp>`_'</samp>, or
<samp>`-'</samp> (dash).  The definition is taken to begin at the first
non-whitespace character following the name, and continuing to the end
of the line.  The definition can subsequently be referred to using
<samp>`{<var>name</var>}'</samp>, which will expand to <samp>`(<var>definition</var>)'</samp>.
For example,

</p>

<pre>DIGIT    [0-9]
ID       [a-z][a-z0-9]*
</pre>

<p>
defines <samp>`DIGIT'</samp> to be a regular expression which matches a single
digit, and <samp>`ID'</samp> to be a regular expression which matches a letter
followed by zero or more letters or digits.  A subsequent reference to

</p>

<pre>{DIGIT}+"."{DIGIT}*
</pre>

<p>
is identical to

</p>

<pre>([0-9])+"."([0-9])*
</pre>

<p>
and matches one or more digits followed by a <samp>`.'</samp> followed by zero
or more digits.

</p>
<p>
The rules section of the <code>flex</code> input contains a series of rules of
the form:

</p>

<pre><var>pattern</var>   <var>action</var>
</pre>

<p>
where the <var>pattern</var> must be unindented and the <var>action</var> must
begin on the same line.

</p>
<p>
See below for a further description of patterns and actions.

</p>
<p>
Finally, the user code section is simply copied to <tt>`lex.yy.c'</tt>
verbatim.  It is used for companion routines which call or are called by
the scanner.  The presence of this section is optional; if it is
missing, the second <samp>`%%'</samp> in the input file may be skipped, too.

</p>
<p>
In the definitions and rules sections, any indented text or text
enclosed in <samp>`%{'</samp> and <samp>`%}'</samp> is copied verbatim to the output
(with the <samp>`%{}'</samp> removed).  The <samp>`%{}'</samp> must appear
unindented on lines by themselves.

</p>
<p>
In the rules section, any indented or <samp>`%{}'</samp> text appearing before
the first rule may be used to declare variables which are local to the
scanning routine and (after the declarations) code which is to be
executed whenever the scanning routine is entered.  Other indented or
<samp>`%{}'</samp> text in the rule section is still copied to the output, but
its meaning is not well defined and it may well cause compile-time
errors (this feature is present for POSIX compliance; see below for
other such features).

</p>
<p>
In the definitions section, an unindented comment (i.e., a line
beginning with <samp>`/*'</samp>) is also copied verbatim to the output up to
the next <samp>`*/'</samp>.  Also, any line in the definitions section beginning
with <samp>`#'</samp> is ignored, though this style of comment is deprecated and
may go away in the future.

</p>



<h3><a name="SEC7" href="http://perso.esiee.fr/~najmanl/compil/Flex/flex_toc.html#SEC7">Patterns in the Input</a></h3>

<p>
The patterns in the input are written using an extended set of regular
expressions.  These are:

</p>
<dl compact="">

<dt><code><var>x</var></code>
</dt><dd>
match the character <samp>`<var>x</var>'</samp>

</dd><dt><code>.</code>
</dt><dd>
any character except newline

</dd><dt><code>[xyz]</code>
</dt><dd>
a "character class"; in this case, the pattern matches either an
<samp>`x'</samp>, a <samp>`y'</samp>, or a <samp>`z'</samp>

</dd><dt><code>[abj-oZ]</code>
</dt><dd>
a "character class" with a range in it; matches an <samp>`a'</samp>, a
<samp>`b'</samp>, any letter from <samp>`j'</samp> through <samp>`o'</samp>, or a <samp>`Z'</samp>

</dd><dt><code>[^A-Z]</code>
</dt><dd>
a "negated character class", i.e., any character but those in the
class.  In this case, any character <em>except</em> an uppercase letter.

</dd><dt><code>[^A-Z\n]</code>
</dt><dd>
any character <em>except</em> an uppercase letter or a newline

</dd><dt><code><var>r</var>*</code>
</dt><dd>
zero or more <var>r</var>'s, where <var>r</var> is any regular expression

</dd><dt><code><var>r</var>+</code>
</dt><dd>
one or more <var>r</var>'s

</dd><dt><code><var>r</var>?         zero or one <var>r</var>'s (that is, "an optional <var>r</var>")</code>
</dt><dd>
</dd><dt><code><var>r</var>{2,5}</code>
</dt><dd>
anywhere from two to five <var>r</var>'s

</dd><dt><code><var>r</var>{2,}</code>
</dt><dd>
two or more <var>r</var>'s

</dd><dt><code><var>r</var>{4}</code>
</dt><dd>
exactly 4 <var>r</var>'s

</dd><dt><code>{<var>name</var>}</code>
</dt><dd>
the expansion of the <var>name</var> definition (see above)

</dd><dt><code>"[xyz]\"foo"</code>
</dt><dd>
the literal string: <samp>`[xyz]"foo'</samp>

</dd><dt><code>\<var>X</var></code>
</dt><dd>
if <var>X</var> is an <samp>`a'</samp>, <samp>`b'</samp>, <samp>`f'</samp>, <samp>`n'</samp>, <samp>`r'</samp>, <samp>`t'</samp>,
or <samp>`v'</samp>, then the ANSI C interpretation of <samp>`\<var>X</var>'</samp>.
Otherwise, a literal <samp>`<var>X</var>'</samp> (used to escape operators such as
<samp>`*'</samp>)

</dd><dt><code>\123</code>
</dt><dd>
the character with octal value <code>123</code>

</dd><dt><code>\x2a</code>
</dt><dd>
the character with hexadecimal value <code>2a</code>

</dd><dt><code>(<var>r</var>)</code>
</dt><dd>
match an <var>r</var>; parentheses are used to override precedence (see
below)

</dd><dt><code><var>r</var><var>s</var></code>
</dt><dd>
the regular expression <var>r</var> followed by the regular expression
<var>s</var>; called "concatenation"

</dd><dt><code><var>r</var>|<var>s</var></code>
</dt><dd>
either an <var>r</var> or an <var>s</var>

</dd><dt><code><var>r</var>/<var>s</var></code>
</dt><dd>
an <var>r</var> but only if it is followed by an <var>s</var>.  The <var>s</var> is not
part of the matched text.  This type of pattern is called <strong>trailing
context</strong>.

</dd><dt><code>^<var>r</var></code>
</dt><dd>
an <var>r</var>, but only at the beginning of a line

</dd><dt><code><var>r</var>$</code>
</dt><dd>
an <var>r</var>, but only at the end of a line.  Equivalent to <samp>`r/\n'</samp>.

</dd><dt><code>&lt;<var>s</var>&gt;<var>r</var></code>
</dt><dd>
an <var>r</var>, but only in start condition <var>s</var> (see below for
discussion of start conditions)

</dd><dt><code>&lt;<var>s1</var>,<var>s2</var>,<var>s3</var>&gt;<var>r</var></code>
</dt><dd>
same, but in any of start conditions <var>s1</var>, <var>s2</var>, or <var>s3</var>

</dd><dt><code>&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;</code>
</dt><dd>
an end-of-file

</dd><dt><code>&lt;<var>s1</var>,<var>s2</var>&gt;&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;</code>
</dt><dd>
an end-of-file when in start condition <var>s1</var> or <var>s2</var>
</dd></dl>

<p>
The regular expressions listed above are grouped according to
precedence, from highest precedence at the top to lowest at the bottom.
Those grouped together have equal precedence.  For example,

</p>

<pre>foo|bar*
</pre>

<p>
is the same as

</p>

<pre>(foo)|(ba(r*))
</pre>

<p>
since the <samp>`*'</samp> operator has higher precedence than concatenation,
and concatenation higher than alternation (<samp>`|'</samp>).  This pattern
therefore matches either the string <samp>`foo'</samp> or the string <samp>`ba'</samp>
followed by zero or more instances of <samp>`r'</samp>.  To match <samp>`foo'</samp> or
zero or more instances of <samp>`bar'</samp>, use:

</p>

<pre>foo|(bar)*
</pre>

<p>
and to match zero or more instances of either <samp>`foo'</samp> or <samp>`bar'</samp>:

</p>

<pre>(foo|bar)*
</pre>

<p>
Some notes on patterns:

</p>

<ul>
<li>

A negated character class such as the example <samp>`[^A-Z]'</samp> above will
match a newline unless <samp>`\n'</samp> (or an equivalent escape sequence) is
one of the characters explicitly present in the negated character class
(e.g., <samp>`[^A-Z\n]'</samp>).  This is unlike how many other regular
expression tools treat negated character classes, but unfortunately the
inconsistency is historically entrenched.  Matching newlines means that
a pattern like <samp>`[^"]*'</samp> can match an entire input (overflowing the
scanner's input buffer) unless there's another quote in the input.

</li><li>

A rule can have at most one instance of trailing context (the <samp>`/'</samp>
operator or the <samp>`$'</samp> operator).  The start condition, <samp>`^'</samp>, and
<samp>`&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;'</samp> patterns can only occur at the beginning of a pattern,
and, as well as with <samp>`/'</samp> and <samp>`$'</samp>, cannot be grouped inside
parentheses.  A <samp>`^'</samp> which does not occur at the beginning of a rule
or a <samp>`$'</samp> which does not occur at the end of a rule loses its
special properties and is treated as a normal character.
</li></ul>

<p>
The following are illegal:

</p>

<pre>foo/bar$
&lt;sc1&gt;foo&lt;sc2&gt;bar
</pre>

<p>
You can write the first of these instead as <samp>`foo/bar\n'</samp>.

</p>
<p>
In the following examples, <samp>`$'</samp> and <samp>`^'</samp> are treated as
normal characters:

</p>

<pre>foo|(bar$)
foo|^bar
</pre>

<p>
If what you want to specify is "either <samp>`foo'</samp>, or <samp>`bar'</samp>
followed by a newline" you can use the following (the special <samp>`|'</samp>
action is explained below):

</p>

<pre>foo      |
bar$     /* action goes here */
</pre>

<p>
A similar trick will work for matching "either <samp>`foo'</samp>, or <samp>`bar'</samp>
at the beginning of a line."

</p>


<h3><a name="SEC8" href="http://perso.esiee.fr/~najmanl/compil/Flex/flex_toc.html#SEC8">How the Input is Matched</a></h3>

<p>
When the generated scanner runs, it analyzes its input looking for
strings which match any of its patterns.  If it finds more than one
match, it takes the one matching the most text (for trailing context
rules, this includes the length of the trailing part, even though it
will then be returned to the input).  If it finds two or more matches of
the same length, the rule listed first in the <code>flex</code> input file is
chosen.

</p>
<p>
Once the match is determined, the text corresponding to the match
(called the <strong>token</strong>) is made available in the global character
pointer <code>yytext</code>, and its length in the global integer
<code>yyleng</code>. The action corresponding to the matched pattern is then
executed (a more detailed description of actions follows), and then the
remaining input is scanned for another match.

</p>
<p>
If no match is found, then the default rule is executed: the next
character in the input is considered matched and copied to the standard
output.  Thus, the simplest legal <code>flex</code> input is:

</p>

<pre>%%
</pre>

<p>
which generates a scanner that simply copies its input (one character at
a time) to its output.

</p>


<h3><a name="SEC9" href="http://perso.esiee.fr/~najmanl/compil/Flex/flex_toc.html#SEC9">Actions</a></h3>
<p>
Each pattern in a rule has a corresponding action, which can be any
arbitrary C statement.  The pattern ends at the first non-escaped
whitespace character; the remainder of the line is its action.  If the
action is empty, then when the pattern is matched the input token is
simply discarded.  For example, here is the specification for a program
which deletes all occurrences of <samp>`zap me'</samp> from its input:

</p>

<pre>%%
"zap me"
</pre>

<p>
(It will copy all other characters in the input to the output since they
will be matched by the default rule.)

</p>
<p>
Here is a program which compresses multiple blanks and tabs down to a
single blank, and throws away whitespace found at the end of a line:

</p>

<pre>%%
[ \t]+        putchar( ' ' );
[ \t]+$       /* ignore this token */
</pre>

<p>
If the action contains a <samp>`{'</samp>, then the action spans till the
balancing <samp>`}'</samp> is found, and the action may cross multiple lines.
<code>flex</code> knows about C strings and comments and won't be fooled by
braces found within them, but also allows actions to begin with
<samp>`%{'</samp> and will consider the action to be all the text up to the
next <samp>`%}'</samp> (regardless of ordinary braces inside the action).

</p>
<p>
An action consisting solely of a vertical bar (<samp>`|'</samp>) means "same as
the action for the next rule."  See below for an illustration.

</p>
<p>
Actions can include arbitrary C code, including return statements to
return a value to whatever routine called <code>yylex</code>. Each time
<code>yylex</code> is called it continues processing tokens from where it last
left off until it either reaches the end of the file or executes a
return.  Once it reaches an end-of-file, however, then any subsequent
call to <code>yylex</code> will simply immediately return, unless
<code>yyrestart</code> is first called (see below).

</p>
<p>
Actions are not allowed to modify <samp>`yytext'</samp> or <samp>`yyleng'</samp>.

</p>
<p>
There are a number of special directives which can be included within an
action:

</p>
<dl compact="">

<dt><code>ECHO</code>
</dt><dd>
copies <code>yytext</code> to the scanner's output.

</dd><dt><code>BEGIN</code>
</dt><dd>
followed by the name of a start condition places the scanner in the
corresponding start condition (see below).

</dd><dt><code>REJECT</code>
</dt><dd>
directs the scanner to proceed on to the "second best" rule which
matched the input (or a prefix of the input).  The rule is chosen as
described above in section <a href="http://perso.esiee.fr/~najmanl/compil/Flex/flex_2.html#SEC8">How the Input is Matched</a>, and
<code>yytext</code> and <code>yyleng</code> set up appropriately.  It may either be
one which matched as much text as the originally chosen rule but came
later in the <code>flex</code> input file, or one which matched less text.
For example, the following will both count the words in the input and
call the routine <code>special</code> whenever <samp>`frob'</samp> is seen:


<pre>        int word_count = 0;
%%

frob        special(); REJECT;
[^ \t\n]+   ++word_count;
</pre>

Without the <code>REJECT</code>, any <samp>`frob'</samp> in the input would not be
counted as a word, since the scanner normally executes only one action
per token.  Multiple <code>REJECT</code> actions are allowed, each one finding
the next best choice to the currently active rule.  For example, when
the following scanner scans the token <samp>`abcd'</samp>, it will write
<samp>`abcdabcaba'</samp> to the output:


<pre>%%
a        |
ab       |
abc      |
abcd     ECHO; REJECT;
.|\n     /* eat up any unmatched character */
</pre>

(The first three rules share the fourth's action, since they use the
special <samp>`|'</samp> action.) <code>REJECT</code> is a particularly expensive
feature in terms of scanner performance; if it is used in any of the
scanner's actions, it will slow down all of the scanner's matching.
Furthermore, <code>REJECT</code> cannot be used with the <samp>`-f'</samp> or
<samp>`-F'</samp> options (see below).

Note also that unlike the other special actions, <code>REJECT</code> is a
branch; code immediately following it in the action will not be
executed.

</dd><dt><code>yymore()</code>
</dt><dd>
tells the scanner that the next time it matches a rule, the
corresponding token should be appended onto the current value of
<code>yytext</code> rather than replacing it.  For example, given the input
<samp>`mega-kludge'</samp> the following will write <samp>`mega-mega-kludge'</samp> to
the output:


<pre>%%
mega-    ECHO; yymore();
kludge   ECHO;
</pre>

First <samp>`mega-'</samp> is matched and echoed to the output.  Then
<samp>`kludge'</samp> is matched, but the previous <samp>`mega-'</samp> is still hanging
around at the beginning of yytext so the ECHO for the <samp>`kludge'</samp> rule
will actually write <samp>`mega-kludge'</samp>.  The presence of <code>yymore</code>
in the scanner's action entails a minor performance penalty in the
scanner's matching speed.

</dd><dt><code>yyless(<var>n</var>)</code>
</dt><dd>
returns all but the first <var>n</var> characters of the current token back
to the input stream, where they will be rescanned when the scanner looks
for the next match.  <code>yytext</code> and <code>yyleng</code> are adjusted
appropriately (e.g., <code>yyleng</code> will now be equal to <var>n</var>).  For
example, on the input <samp>`foobar'</samp> the following will write out
<samp>`foobarbar'</samp>:


<pre>%%
foobar    ECHO; yyless(3);
[a-z]+    ECHO;
</pre>

<samp>`yyless(0)'</samp> will cause the entire current input string to be
scanned again.  Unless you've changed how the scanner will subsequently
process its input (using <code>BEGIN</code>, for example), this will result in
an endless loop.

</dd><dt><code>unput(<var>c</var>)</code>
</dt><dd>
puts the character <var>c</var> back onto the input stream.  It will be the
next character scanned.  The following action will take the current
token and cause it to be rescanned enclosed in parentheses.


<pre>{
int i;
unput( ')' );
for ( i = yyleng - 1; i &gt;= 0; --i )
    unput( yytext[i] );
unput( '(' );
}
</pre>

Note that since each <code>unput</code> puts the  given  character
back at the beginning of the input stream, pushing back
strings must be done back-to-front.

</dd><dt><code>input()</code>
</dt><dd>
reads the next character from the input stream.  For example, the
following is one way to eat up C comments:


<pre>%%
"/*"        {
            register int c;

            for ( ; ; )
                {
                while ( (c = input()) != '*' &amp;&amp;
                        c != EOF )
                    ; /* eat up text of comment */

                if ( c == '*' )
                    {
                    while ( (c = input()) == '*' )
                        ;
                    if ( c == '/' )
                        break; /* found the end */
                    }

                if ( c == EOF )
                    {
                    error( "EOF in comment" );
                    break;
                    }
                }
            }
</pre>

(Note that if the scanner is compiled using C++, then <code>input</code> is
instead referred to as <code>yyinput</code>, in order to avoid a name clash
with the C++ stream named <code>input</code>.)

</dd><dt><code>yyterminate()</code>
</dt><dd>
can be used in lieu of a <code>return</code> statement in an action.  It terminates
the scanner and returns a 0 to the scanner's caller, indicating
<samp>`all done'</samp>.  Subsequent calls to the scanner will immediately
return unless preceded by a call to <code>yyrestart</code> (see below).  By
default, <code>yyterminate</code> is also called when an end-of-file is
encountered.  It is a macro and may be redefined.
</dd></dl>



<h2><a name="SEC10" href="http://perso.esiee.fr/~najmanl/compil/Flex/flex_toc.html#SEC10">The Generated Scanner</a></h2>

<p>
The output of <code>flex</code> is the file <tt>`lex.yy.c'</tt>, which contains
the scanning routine <code>yylex</code>, a number of tables used by it for
matching tokens, and a number of auxiliary routines and macros.  By
default, <code>yylex</code> is declared as follows:

</p>

<pre>int yylex()
    {
    ... various definitions and the actions in here ...
    }
</pre>

<p>
(If your environment supports function prototypes, then it will be
<samp>`int yylex( void )'</samp>.)  This definition may be changed by redefining
the <code>YY_DECL</code> macro.  For example, you could use:

</p>

<pre>#undef YY_DECL
#define YY_DECL float lexscan( a, b ) float a, b;
</pre>

<p>
to give the scanning routine the name <code>lexscan</code>, returning a
<code>float</code>, and taking two <code>float</code> values as arguments.  Note
that if you give arguments to the scanning routine using a
K&amp;R-style/non-prototyped function declaration, you must terminate the
definition with a semicolon (<samp>`;'</samp>).

</p>
<p>
Whenever <code>yylex</code> is called, it scans tokens from the global input
file <tt>`yyin'</tt> (which defaults to <tt>`stdin'</tt>).  It continues until
it either reaches an end-of-file (at which point it returns the value 0)
or one of its actions executes a return statement.  In the former case,
when called again the scanner will immediately return unless
<code>yyrestart</code> is called to point <tt>`yyin'</tt> at the new input file.
(<code>yyrestart</code> takes one argument, a <samp>`FILE *'</samp> pointer.) In the
latter case (i.e., when an action executes a return), the scanner may
then be called again and it will resume scanning where it left off.

</p>
<p>
By default (and for efficiency), the scanner uses block-reads rather
than simple <code>getc</code> calls to read characters from <tt>`yyin'</tt>.  You
can control how it gets input by redefining the <code>YY_INPUT</code> macro.
<code>YY_INPUT</code>'s calling sequence is
<samp>`YY_INPUT(<var>buf</var>,<var>result</var>,<var>max_size</var>)'</samp>.  Its action is
to place up to <var>max_size</var> characters in the character array
<var>buf</var> and return in the integer variable result either the number of
characters read or the constant <code>YY_NULL</code> (0 on Unix systems) to
indicate EOF.  The default <code>YY_INPUT</code> reads from the global
file-pointer <tt>`yyin'</tt>.

</p>
<p>
A sample redefinition of <code>YY_INPUT</code> (in the definitions section
of the input file):

</p>

<pre>%{
#undef YY_INPUT
#define YY_INPUT(buf,result,max_size) \
    { \
    int c = getchar(); \
    result = (c == EOF) ? YY_NULL : (buf[0] = c, 1); \
    }
%}
</pre>

<p>
This definition will change the input processing to occur one character
at a time.

</p>
<p>
You also can add in things like keeping track of the input line number
this way; but don't expect your scanner to go very fast.

</p>
<p>
When the scanner receives an end-of-file indication from
<code>YY_INPUT</code>, it then checks the <code>yywrap</code> function.  If
<code>yywrap</code> returns false (zero), then it is assumed that the function
has gone ahead and set up <tt>`yyin'</tt> to point to another input file,
and scanning continues.  If it returns true (non-zero), then the
scanner terminates, returning 0 to its caller.

</p>
<p>
The default <code>yywrap</code> always returns 1.  At present, to redefine it
you must first <samp>`#undef yywrap'</samp>, as it is currently implemented as a
macro.  As indicated by the hedging in the previous sentence, it may be
changed to a true function in the near future.

</p>
<p>
The scanner writes its  <code>ECHO</code>  output  to  the  <tt>`yyout'</tt>  global
(default, <tt>`stdout'</tt>), which may be redefined by the user simply
by assigning it to some other <code>FILE</code> pointer.

</p>


<h2><a name="SEC11" href="http://perso.esiee.fr/~najmanl/compil/Flex/flex_toc.html#SEC11">Start Conditions</a></h2>

<p>
<code>flex</code> provides a mechanism for conditionally activating rules.
Any rule whose pattern is prefixed with <samp>`&lt;<var>sc</var>&gt;'</samp> will only be
active when the scanner is in the start condition named <var>sc</var>.  For
example,

</p>

<pre>&lt;STRING&gt;[^"]*        { /* eat up the string body ... */
            ...
            }
</pre>

<p>
will be active only when the  scanner  is  in  the  <samp>`STRING'</samp>
start condition, and

</p>

<pre>&lt;INITIAL,STRING,QUOTE&gt;\.        { /* handle an escape ... */
            ...
            }
</pre>

<p>
will be active only when the current start condition is either
<samp>`INITIAL'</samp>, <samp>`STRING'</samp>, or <samp>`QUOTE'</samp>.

</p>
<p>
Start conditions are declared in the definitions (first) section of the
input using unindented lines beginning with either <samp>`%s'</samp> or
<samp>`%x'</samp> followed by a list of names.  The former declares
<em>inclusive</em> start conditions, the latter <em>exclusive</em> start
conditions.  A start condition is activated using the <code>BEGIN</code>
action.  Until the next <code>BEGIN</code> action is executed, rules with the
given start condition will be active and rules with other start
conditions will be inactive.  If the start condition is inclusive, then
rules with no start conditions at all will also be active.  If it is
exclusive, then only rules qualified with the start condition will be
active.  A set of rules contingent on the same exclusive start condition
describe a scanner which is independent of any of the other rules in the
<code>flex</code> input.  Because of this, exclusive start conditions make it
easy to specify "miniscanners" which scan portions of the input that
are syntactically different from the rest (e.g., comments).

</p>
<p>
If the distinction between inclusive and exclusive start conditions is
still a little vague, here's a simple example illustrating the
connection between the two.  The set of rules:

</p>

<pre>%s example
%%
&lt;example&gt;foo           /* do something */
</pre>

<p>
is equivalent to

</p>

<pre>%x example
%%
&lt;INITIAL,example&gt;foo   /* do something */
</pre>

<p>
The default rule (to ECHO any unmatched character) remains active in
start conditions.

</p>
<p>
<samp>`BEGIN(0)'</samp> returns to the original state where only the rules with
no start conditions are active.  This state can also be referred to as
the start-condition <samp>`INITIAL'</samp>, so <samp>`BEGIN(INITIAL)'</samp> is
equivalent to <samp>`BEGIN(0)'</samp>. (The parentheses around the start
condition name are not required but are considered good style.)

</p>
<p>
<code>BEGIN</code> actions can also be given as indented code at the beginning
of the rules section.  For example, the following will cause the scanner
to enter the <samp>`SPECIAL'</samp> start condition whenever <code>yylex</code> is
called and the global variable enter_special is true:

</p>

<pre>        int enter_special;

%x SPECIAL
%%
        if ( enter_special )
            BEGIN(SPECIAL);

&lt;SPECIAL&gt;blahblahblah
... more rules follow ...
</pre>

<p>
To illustrate the uses of start conditions, here is a scanner which
provides two different interpretations of a string like <samp>`123.456'</samp>.
By default this scanner will treat the string as three tokens: the
integer <samp>`123'</samp>, a dot <samp>`.'</samp>, and the integer <samp>`456'</samp>.  But if
the string is preceded earlier in the line by the string
<samp>`expect-floats'</samp> it will treat it as a single token, the
floating-point number <code>123.456</code>:

</p>

<pre>%{
#include &lt;math.h&gt;
%}
%s expect

%%
expect-floats        BEGIN(expect);

&lt;expect&gt;[0-9]+"."[0-9]+      {
            printf( "found a float, = %f\n",
                    atof( yytext ) );
            }
&lt;expect&gt;\n           {
            /* that's the end of the line, so
             * we need another "expect-number"
             * before we'll recognize any more
             * numbers
             */
            BEGIN(INITIAL);
            }

[0-9]+      {
            printf( "found an integer, = %d\n",
                    atoi( yytext ) );
            }

"."         printf( "found a dot\n" );
</pre>

<p>
Here is a scanner which recognizes (and discards) C comments while
maintaining a count of the current input line.

</p>

<pre>%x comment
%%
        int line_num = 1;

"/*"         BEGIN(comment);

&lt;comment&gt;[^*\n]*        /* eat anything that's not a '*' */
&lt;comment&gt;"*"+[^*/\n]*   /* eat up '*'s not followed by '/'s */
&lt;comment&gt;\n             ++line_num;
&lt;comment&gt;"*"+"/"        BEGIN(INITIAL);
</pre>

<p>
Note that start-conditions names are really integer values and can be
stored as such.  Thus, the above could be extended in the following
fashion:

</p>

<pre>%x comment foo
%%
        int line_num = 1;
        int comment_caller;

"/*"         {
             comment_caller = INITIAL;
             BEGIN(comment);
             }

...

&lt;foo&gt;"/*"    {
             comment_caller = foo;
             BEGIN(comment);
             }

&lt;comment&gt;[^*\n]*        /* eat anything that's not a '*' */
&lt;comment&gt;"*"+[^*/\n]*   /* eat up '*'s not followed by '/'s */
&lt;comment&gt;\n             ++line_num;
&lt;comment&gt;"*"+"/"        BEGIN(comment_caller);
</pre>

<p>
One can then implement a "stack" of start conditions using an array of
integers.  (It is likely that such stacks will become a full-fledged
<code>flex</code> feature in the future.)  Note, though, that start conditions
do not have their own namespace; <samp>`%s'</samp> and <samp>`%x'</samp> declare names
in the same fashion as <code>#define</code>.

</p>


<h2><a name="SEC12" href="http://perso.esiee.fr/~najmanl/compil/Flex/flex_toc.html#SEC12">Multiple Input Buffers</a></h2>

<p>
Some scanners (such as those which support "include" files) require
reading from several input streams.  As <code>flex</code> scanners do a large
amount of buffering, one cannot control where the next input will be
read from by simply writing a <code>YY_INPUT</code> which is sensitive to the
scanning context.  <code>YY_INPUT</code> is only called when the scanner
reaches the end of its buffer, which may be a long time after scanning a
statement such as an "include" which requires switching the input
source.

</p>
<p>
To negotiate these sorts of problems, <code>flex</code> provides a mechanism
for creating and switching between multiple input buffers.  An input
buffer is created by using:

</p>

<pre>YY_BUFFER_STATE yy_create_buffer( FILE *<var>file</var>, int <var>size</var> )
</pre>

<p>
which takes a <code>FILE</code> pointer and a size and creates a buffer
associated with the given file and large enough to hold <var>size</var>
characters (when in doubt, use <code>YY_BUF_SIZE</code> for the size).  It
returns a <code>YY_BUFFER_STATE</code> handle, which may then be passed to
other routines:

</p>

<pre>void yy_switch_to_buffer( YY_BUFFER_STATE <var>new_buffer</var> )
</pre>

<p>
switches the scanner's input buffer so subsequent tokens will come from
<var>new_buffer</var>. Note that <code>yy_switch_to_buffer</code> may be used by
<code>yywrap</code> to sets things up for continued scanning, instead of
opening a new file and pointing <tt>`yyin'</tt> at it.

</p>

<pre>void yy_delete_buffer( YY_BUFFER_STATE <var>buffer</var> )
</pre>

<p>
is used to reclaim the storage associated with a buffer.

</p>
<p>
<code>yy_new_buffer</code> is an alias for <code>yy_create_buffer</code>, provided
for compatibility with the C++ use of <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> for
creating and destroying dynamic objects.

</p>
<p>
Finally, the <code>YY_CURRENT_BUFFER</code> macro returns a
<code>YY_BUFFER_STATE</code> handle to the current buffer.

</p>
<p>
Here is an example of using these features for writing a scanner which
expands include files (the <samp>`&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;'</samp> feature is discussed below):

</p>

<pre>/* the "incl" state is used for picking up the name
 * of an include file
 */
%x incl

%{
#define MAX_INCLUDE_DEPTH 10
YY_BUFFER_STATE include_stack[MAX_INCLUDE_DEPTH];
int include_stack_ptr = 0;
%}

%%
include             BEGIN(incl);

[a-z]+              ECHO;
[^a-z\n]*\n?        ECHO;

&lt;incl&gt;[ \t]*      /* eat the whitespace */
&lt;incl&gt;[^ \t\n]+   { /* got the include file name */
        if ( include_stack_ptr &gt;= MAX_INCLUDE_DEPTH )
            {
            fprintf( stderr, "Includes nested too deeply" );
            exit( 1 );
            }

        include_stack[include_stack_ptr++] =
            YY_CURRENT_BUFFER;

        yyin = fopen( yytext, "r" );

        if ( ! yyin )
            error( ... );

        yy_switch_to_buffer(
            yy_create_buffer( yyin, YY_BUF_SIZE ) );

        BEGIN(INITIAL);
        }

&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt; {
        if ( --include_stack_ptr &lt; 0 )
            {
            yyterminate();
            }

        else
            yy_switch_to_buffer(
                 include_stack[include_stack_ptr] );
        }
</pre>



<h2><a name="SEC13" href="http://perso.esiee.fr/~najmanl/compil/Flex/flex_toc.html#SEC13">End-of-File Rules</a></h2>

<p>
The special rule <samp>`&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;'</samp> indicates actions which are to be taken
when an end-of-file is encountered and <code>yywrap</code> returns non-zero
(i.e., indicates no further files to process).  The action must finish
by doing one of four things:

</p>

<ul>
<li>

the special <code>YY_NEW_FILE</code> action, if <tt>`yyin'</tt> has been pointed
at a new file to process;

</li><li>

a return statement;

</li><li>

the special <code>yyterminate</code> action;

</li><li>

or switching to a new buffer using <code>yy_switch_to_buffer</code> as shown
in the example above.
</li></ul>

<p>
<samp>`&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;'</samp> rules may not be used with other patterns; they may only
be qualified with a list of start conditions.  If an unqualified
<samp>`&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;'</samp> rule is given, it applies to all start conditions which
do not already have <samp>`&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;'</samp> actions.  To specify an
<samp>`&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;'</samp> rule for only the initial start condition, use

</p>

<pre>&lt;INITIAL&gt;&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;
</pre>

<p>
These rules are useful for catching things like unclosed comments.  An
example:

</p>

<pre>%x quote
%%

... other rules for dealing with quotes ...

&lt;quote&gt;&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;   {
         error( "unterminated quote" );
         yyterminate();
         }
&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;  {
         if ( *++filelist )
             {
             yyin = fopen( *filelist, "r" );
             YY_NEW_FILE;
             }
         else
            yyterminate();
         }
</pre>



<h2><a name="SEC14" href="http://perso.esiee.fr/~najmanl/compil/Flex/flex_toc.html#SEC14">Miscellaneous Macros</a></h2>

<p>
The macro <code>YY_USER_ACTION</code> can be redefined to provide an action
which is always executed prior to the matched rule's action.  For
example, it could be <code>#define</code>d to call a routine to convert
<code>yytext</code> to lower-case.

</p>
<p>
The macro <code>YY_USER_INIT</code> may be redefined to provide an action
which is always executed before the first scan (and before the scanner's
internal initializations are done).  For example, it could be used to
call a routine to read in a data table or open a logging file.

</p>
<p>
In the generated scanner, the actions are all gathered in one large
switch statement and separated using <code>YY_BREAK</code>, which may be
redefined.  By default, it is simply a <code>break</code>, to separate each
rule's action from the following rule's.  Redefining <code>YY_BREAK</code>
allows, for example, C++ users to <samp>`#define YY_BREAK'</samp> to do nothing
(while being very careful that every rule ends with a <code>break</code> or a
<code>return</code>!) to avoid suffering from unreachable statement warnings
where because a rule's action ends with <code>return</code>, the
<code>YY_BREAK</code> is inaccessible.

</p>


<h2><a name="SEC15" href="http://perso.esiee.fr/~najmanl/compil/Flex/flex_toc.html#SEC15">Interfacing with Parser Generators</a></h2>
<p>
One of the main uses of <code>flex</code> is as a companion to parser
generators like <code>yacc</code>.  <code>yacc</code> parsers expect to call a
routine named <code>yylex</code> to find the next input token.  The routine is
supposed to return the type of the next token as well as putting any
associated value in the global <code>yylval</code>.  To use <code>flex</code> with
<code>yacc</code>, specify the <samp>`-d'</samp> option to <code>yacc</code> to instruct it
to generate the file <code>y.tab.h</code> containing definitions of all the
<code>%token</code>s appearing in the <code>yacc</code> input.  Then include this
file in the <code>flex</code> scanner.  For example, if one of the tokens is
<samp>`TOK_NUMBER'</samp>, part of the scanner might look like:

</p>

<pre>%{
#include "y.tab.h"
%}

%%

[0-9]+        yylval = atoi( yytext ); return TOK_NUMBER;
</pre>



<h2><a name="SEC16" href="http://perso.esiee.fr/~najmanl/compil/Flex/flex_toc.html#SEC16">Translation Table</a></h2>

<p>
In the name of POSIX compliance, <code>flex</code> supports a translation
table  for  mapping input characters into groups.  The table
is specified in the first  section,  and  its  format  looks
like:

</p>

<pre>%t
1        abcd
2        ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
52       0123456789
6        \t\ \n
%t
</pre>

<p>
This example specifies that the characters <samp>`a'</samp>, <samp>`b'</samp>, <samp>`c'</samp>,
and <samp>`d'</samp> are to all be lumped into group #1, upper-case letters in
group #2, digits in group #52, tabs, blanks, and newlines into group #6,
and no other characters will appear in the patterns.  The group numbers
are actually disregarded by <code>flex</code>; <code>%t</code> serves, though, to
lump characters together.  Given the above table, for example, the
pattern <samp>`a(AA)*5'</samp> is equivalent to <samp>`d(ZQ)*0'</samp>.  They both say,
"match any character in group #1, followed by zero or more pairs of
characters from group #2, followed by a character from group #52."
Thus <samp>`%t'</samp> provides a crude way for introducing equivalence classes
into the scanner specification.

</p>
<p>
Note that  the  <samp>`-i'</samp>  option  (see  below)  coupled  with  the
equivalence  classes which <code>flex</code> automatically generates take
care of virtually all the instances when one might  consider
using <samp>`%t'</samp>. But what the hell, it's there if you want it.
